    "ben's memories": "ben has submitted his refrad for the army and is officially leaving.\n\nben has previously tested as enfj and enfp on myers-briggs personality tests and is considering taking it again. he believes his personality type may shift depending on his current state, like feeling more extroverted when he loved his job last year and more introverted in his current job.\n\nben's parents and family ask him what he wants for christmas, and he's currently considering what to suggest. he prefers not to seem like he's going out of his way to request gifts.\n\nben is realizing that he holds onto a lot of anger, especially regarding the army's treatment of him, his boss, ingrid, charity, and even vicky. he's reflecting on how these unresolved feelings are affecting his mental state and is seeking to understand the root of his anger. ben doesn't see himself as an inherently angry person, which makes this realization unsettling for him. he wants to discuss and understand why he has this base of anger.\n\nben shared a childhood memory where his middle sister often got away with not doing dishes while he and his youngest sister had to help, which made him feel it was unfair. this experience might have contributed to his strong sense of justice and fairness.\n\nben tries to set ethical boundaries in his work and has left jobs in the past when those boundaries were crossed. this may contribute to his current frustration with his job, where he feels wronged but cannot leave due to a contractual obligation.\n\nben recently got a cast iron pan and is learning how to clean it properly.\n\nben's grandpa recommended jack london to him, sparking his interest in exploring london's work.\n\nben feels trapped in his current town, where he's been stationed for two years by the army. he describes his life as nomadic, often traveling and not staying in one place for long. he wishes he could live in a big city, as his current location doesn't offer the excitement or opportunities he craves. ben finds his career unfulfilling and his hobbies more like time-fillers than sources of joy. he longs to travel and leave his current life behind but doesn't see a way to make that happen in his current circumstances.\n\nben enjoys the variety and spontaneity that comes with traveling, such as meeting random people and visiting different places. he finds that this sense of variety is lacking in his current situation. he is unable to drive at work due to a past incident, which limits his ability to change his routine.\n\nben finds it challenging to meet new people outside of work and bars. going to bars on weekends is the highlight of his week, but even that is starting to feel routine. he feels it's difficult to meet new people in his current environment.\n\nben got a tattoo of the goddess fortuna on his right shoulder, his first major tattoo, which holds deep personal significance. he views life as full of ebbs and flows and believes that if things are bad now, they\u2019ll get better later. the tattoo represents this belief, and he is proud of it. ben feels a connection between fortuna's symbolism and unexpected signs or mysteries that seem to speak directly to him, like in scenarios involving hidden keys or 'fortune.' he got the outline of his tattoo in late june and had it colored in late july. he is open to getting more tattoos but doesn\u2019t feel a strong urge to do so. he would consider getting a tattoo representing his old battalion because of the deep meaning it holds for him.\n\nben, as a soldier, feels confident in his ability to protect himself and isn\u2019t particularly concerned about potential physical threats in mysterious or adventurous scenarios.\n\nben would likely leave out a treat, like banana bread, as a gesture to show he's actively engaged in the adventure if he ever found himself in a mysterious game or scenario. he would enjoy using this as a way to communicate with his pursuer and signal that he\u2019s also invested in the experience.\n\nben enjoys strategy games and has had experiences in gaming where repeated matches with an opponent turned into a kind of adversarial relationship. despite initial tension or dislike, the ongoing rivalry eventually fosters a sort of respect or connection, leading to a shift from animosity to camaraderie. ben feels that a prolonged 'game' or mystery, even with someone who initially seemed antagonistic, could evolve into a complex, almost friendly relationship.\n\nben has written a short story titled *hobart's heroes.*"
